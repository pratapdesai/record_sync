# üì¶ Record Sync Service

Bi-directional, event-driven microservice to synchronize CRUD record changes between an internal system (System A) and external CRMs (System B, e.g., Salesforce, Outreach). Designed for high scale, dynamic configuration, rules-based decisioning, and extensibility to new CRMs.
A high-performance, extensible, production-grade Record Synchronization Service that facilitates data transfer and sync across heterogeneous systems such as CRMs (Salesforce, Outreach), databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite), and flat file storage. Supports real-time and batch sync with rule-based transformation, conflict resolution, retry, deduplication, and observability.

## üöÄ üöÄ What Happens When You Run the Service
#### By default, the Record Sync Service launches an automated bi-directional synchronization between:

- System A ‚Üí SQLite database (users table)

- System B ‚Üí Salesforce CRM (mocked or real, based on config)

#### üîÑ What Exactly Starts?

- Pollers are initialized on both sides:
  - One polls the SQLite DB for new/updated records. 
  - One polls the Salesforce CRM for new/updated records.

- Records are:
  - Transformed based on rules.json 
  - Enqueued for syncing 
  - Flushed in controlled batches using the Queue Manager

- Sync is processed via:
  - Retry Manager for failed pushes 
  - Rate Limiter to throttle outbound API calls 
  - Circuit Breaker to isolate failing systems

- Observability is enabled:
  - All actions are logged as structured JSON 
  - Sync status (queued, synced, failed) is tracked per record 
  - All logs currently get stored to /logs/record_sync.log

System can be monitored using the /v1/status API or by tailing the logs.
