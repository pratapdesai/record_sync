# üì¶ Record Sync Service

Bi-directional, event-driven microservice to synchronize CRUD record changes between an internal system (System A) and external CRMs (System B, e.g., Salesforce, Outreach). Designed for high scale, dynamic configuration, rules-based decisioning, and extensibility to new CRMs.
A high-performance, extensible, production-grade Record Synchronization Service that facilitates data transfer and sync across heterogeneous systems such as CRMs (Salesforce, Outreach), databases (PostgreSQL, SQLite), and flat file storage. Supports real-time and batch sync with rule-based transformation, conflict resolution, retry, deduplication, and observability.
