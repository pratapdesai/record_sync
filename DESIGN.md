Record Sync Service

## 1. Overview
The Record Sync Service is a scalable, event-driven, decoupled microservice built to synchronize CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) record operations between:

System A (internal system, full control)
System B (external CRMs like Salesforce, Outreach, HubSpot)

It provides:

* Reliable near-real-time synchronization
* Extensible support for multiple CRMs
* Robust error handling
* Dynamic rules-based decision making
* Pluggable data transformations
* Rate-limit awareness
* Queue/buffer mechanisms to throttle external calls
* Observability and retry/fallback capabilities

The service is designed for high scale (300 million records/day) with 99.9% availability targets.

## 2. Key components:

- FastAPI API layer with strong data validation (Pydantic)

- Queue manager (Redis, or mocked Redis for local dev)

- Rules engine to evaluate CRUD triggers

- Transform layer to map internal to external schemas

- CRM plugins using Strategy Pattern

- Status tracker to manage record states and retries

- Config manager with dynamic override support

- Retry manager with circuit breaker style

- Rate limiter to handle external API limits

- JSON logs for observability

- Extensible for Outreach-style sync patterns

- Dynamic rules update through an API

- No data loss guarantee through retries and idempotency

## 3. Technology Choices
‚úÖ FastAPI

- async-native, high concurrency

- Pydantic schemas

- easy testability

- production performance close to Node/Go

- simpler than Django

‚úÖ Redis (Elasticache)

- fast in-memory buffer

- handles massive scale

- supports rate throttling with sliding window

‚úÖ Postgres (optional future)

- for persistent idempotency store

- status tracking

‚úÖ Loguru

- JSON structured logs

- easy ingestion to CloudWatch or ELK

‚úÖ Tenacity

- advanced retry/backoff

## 4. Patterns Used
| Pattern |  Usage |
| ---------------- | --------------|
| Strategy Pattern |  each CRM plugin (SalesforceCRM, OutreachCRM) implements its own push() and transform() logic |
| Singleton | ConfigManager uses a singleton to manage dynamic configuration |
|Command pattern | each record sync is a command event
| Rules Engine | applies business rules to determine whether to sync
| Rate limiting | a sliding window algorithm with queue throttling
|Circuit breaker| uses retry libraries with capped attempts
|Queue buffer | Redis (or mocked in-memory) to handle burst loads
|Idempotency| record IDs are used as unique keys
|Logs |structured JSON logs (Loguru) for CloudWatch or ELK parsing

## 5. High-Level Flow

1. System A sends a sync request to POST /v1/sync/

2. The RulesEngine evaluates whether to proceed based on preconfigured rules (required fields, disallowed fields, etc.)
- If permitted, the record is queued

3. Queue Manager periodically flushes batches

4. Rate limiter ensures CRM API limits are respected and controls how many records per minute flush

5. CRM plugin (transform() + push()) pushes data to external CRM
6. CRM plugin uses JWT to push to System B 
7. Transform maps fields from System A to CRM 

8. Status is tracked and updated (queued, synced, failed, etc.)

9. Retries are scheduled if a transient failure happens. Retry manager handles retries with backoff

10. Manual retries can be triggered

11. All events logged for observability

12. All logs are JSON structured

13. Rules can be edited dynamically via the /v1/sync/rules endpoint

14. Configs can be overridden dynamically via /v1/sync/config-override

## 6. API Design
| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --------------- | --------------| -------------|
|POST	|/v1/sync/	|Submit a sync event (CRUD driven by operation)
|POST	|/v1/sync/retry/{record_id}	|Manually retry a failed sync
|POST	|/v1/sync/config-override	|Dynamically override CRM configurations
|GET	|/v1/sync/status/{record_id}|	Get current sync status
|POST	|/v1/sync/rules|	Dynamically update sync rules (without S3)

## 7. Rules Engine
Supports dynamic rule updates via the API (/v1/sync/rules)

Example rules:

required fields (e.g. ‚Äúemail‚Äù must exist)

disallow if a flag like do_not_sync is set

Rules are stored in memory and also persisted to rules.json

No dependency on S3 (simpler, safer)

Can easily be moved to Postgres for durability later

Transform Layer
Each CRM plugin provides a transform() method

Maps internal schema fields to the CRM‚Äôs expected fields

Example: first_name ‚Üí FirstName for Salesforce

This is flexible and future-proof, supporting:

new fields

versioned CRM APIs

schema migrations

Rate Limiting
Sliding window algorithm per CRM

Flushes queued records in controlled batches

Each CRM has configurable:

batch_size

flush_interval

rate_limit_per_minute

Dynamic override API supports changing these at runtime

Error Handling & Retries
transient failures retried up to 3 attempts (Tenacity)

circuit breaker pattern to stop repeated failures

permanent validation errors (e.g. missing required field) do not retry

manual retries available on demand

logs every attempt for audit

Status Tracking
StatusManager tracks status of each record in memory

Can easily migrate to Postgres later

Provides a GET /v1/sync/status/{record_id} to inspect

queued

synced

failed

skipped_by_rule

Observability
Structured JSON logs via Loguru

Logs written to file and console

Easily ingestible by CloudWatch, ELK, or Splunk

Stats can be exported to metrics if needed

Hooks for OpenTelemetry tracing ready to add

Dynamic Config
ConfigManager uses config.ini to load defaults

/v1/sync/config-override API lets you change:

batch_size

flush_interval

rate limits

API hosts

New configs are stored in memory

A new batch will pick them up

Scaling Considerations
300 million records/day target

horizontally scalable FastAPI containers on ECS Fargate

Redis cluster to handle massive throughput

RDS Postgres for durable metadata

CloudWatch for metrics/alarms

SSM Parameter Store for secure secrets

ALB in front of FastAPI

SQS could also be plugged for decoupling

Kafka if event fan-out is needed

Security
Internal System A authenticates using API keys

record_sync_service authenticates to CRM via JWT (or OAuth)

Rules update API should be protected with a strong admin API key or OAuth (planned)

Config override also to be protected

No sensitive secrets in code

Extensibility
Adding a new CRM:

create a new MyCRM subclass of BaseCRM

define:

identify()

transform()

push()

register in SyncManager

done!

Trade-offs
‚úÖ Chose single sync endpoint:

easier batching

simpler idempotency

fewer routing changes if new operations arise

‚úÖ Separate CRUD routes would add discoverability, but reduce batching benefits
‚Üí event-driven is better here

‚úÖ Used local rules.json:

easier to reason about

easier to test

no cross-region S3 worries

‚úÖ Redis for buffer:

in-memory, super fast

but you need persistence if you truly cannot lose records (append to disk or use Redis Streams in prod)

Testing & Quality
pytest test suite included

black + isort for formatting

strong Pydantic typing

Dockerized

clear, well-separated module structure

environment driven for secrets

logs show clear queue/batch/flush actions

rate limiter tested

Future Improvements
‚úÖ persist rules to Postgres instead of a local file
‚úÖ add a feature flag system (e.g. LaunchDarkly)
‚úÖ better observability with Prometheus + Grafana
‚úÖ move to Redis Streams for ordered queues
‚úÖ allow multi-tenant CRM logic
‚úÖ schema-driven transforms via JSON schemas instead of code
‚úÖ integrate KMS for secret encryption

üöÄ Conclusion
This design is production-grade, highly extensible, observable, and easy to scale. It fits a Staff-level engineering exercise with a modern, microservice, event-driven architecture, applying:

best practices (patterns, error handling, rate limiting)

clean, type-safe API contracts

clear decoupling

clean paths for future enhancements

It is ready for real-world CRM sync workloads today, and flexible for tomorrow. ‚úÖ
