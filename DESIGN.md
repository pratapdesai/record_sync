# Record Sync Service

## 1. Overview
The Record Sync Service is a scalable, event-driven, decoupled microservice built to synchronize CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) record operations between:

System A (internal system, full control)
System B (external CRMs like Salesforce, Outreach, HubSpot)

It provides:

* Reliable near-real-time synchronization
* Extensible support for multiple CRMs
* Robust error handling
* Dynamic rules-based decision-making
* Pluggable data transformations
* Rate-limit awareness
* Queue/buffer mechanisms to throttle external calls
* Observability and retry/fallback capabilities

The service is designed for high scale (300 million records/day) with 99.9% availability targets.

### Architecture

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

- Layered architecture 
  - systems/  ‚Üí Source/sink implementations (sqlite, file)
  - crms/     ‚Üí External CRM adapters (salesforce, outreach)
  - services/ ‚Üí Pollers, queue, rules engine, circuit breaker 
  - api/      ‚Üí FastAPI endpoints 
  - tests/    ‚Üí Unit test files
  - core/     ‚Üí Config loaders, constants
  - models/   ‚Üí Models of record, config

- Parallels to AWS Glue / DataPipelines 
  - Can schedule, trigger or daemonize sync jobs 
  - Works with both push + pull semantics

## 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Component Responsibilities

### üîÅ Pollers

- Watch for changes in data sources (like SQLite or CRM)
- Trigger sync logic in real-time

### ‚öñÔ∏è RulesEngine

- Field mapping

- Validation: required/missing/disallowed fields

- Filtering records

### üö™ CRM Plugin (Salesforce/Outreach)

- transform() ‚Äì prepares data structure for CRM

- push() ‚Äì pushes data using mocked or real API

### üï≥ CircuitBreaker

- Opens after threshold failures

- Prevents repeated failing attempts

### üö• RateLimiter

- Uses records_per_minute to pace requests to CRMs

### üîÅ RetryManager

- Retries transient failures

- Retries are queued and backoff is supported

üéØ StatusTracker

- Tracks:

  - total_synced, failed, queued 
  - last_sync_time, retries_pending, pollers_active 
  - GET /v1/status returns this JSON

### üóÇ Config Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| rules.json|  Field mapping and validation rules|
 | sync_config.json | Defines source/sink systems, CRM direction|
| config.ini| Holds credentials for CRM systems|

## 5. High-Level Flow
![img.png](img.png)
### Record Sync Service offers wide range of services described as below

  - #### üîÅ 1. Automated Bidirectional Syncs (Background Pollers)
    ```
    START (Poller Startup)
      ‚Üì
    [Polling Loop Begins for Each Direction]
      ‚Üì
    System A or B fetches delta records via pull()
      ‚Üì
    Each record goes through RulesEngine:
      ‚Üí Validates required fields
      ‚Üí Applies field mapping and filters
      ‚Üì
    If allowed by rules:
      ‚Üí Record is queued in Queue Manager
      ‚Üì
    Queue Manager periodically flushes in batches
      ‚Üì
    Rate Limiter controls batch frequency (respect CRM limits)
      ‚Üì
    CRM Plugin is invoked
        ‚Üí .transform() maps fields to target schema
        ‚Üí .push() (or push_actual()) sends record using JWT-auth
      ‚Üì
    Status is tracked:
      ‚Üí queued ‚Üí synced / failed
      ‚Üì
    On transient failures:
      ‚Üí RetryManager retries with exponential backoff
      ‚Üì
    All actions and transitions logged (JSON logs)
      ‚Ü∫ (Loop repeats)
    ```
  - #### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2. Manual One-way Sync (API-Triggered via /v1/sync/manual)
    ```
    System A sends POST request to /v1/sync/manual?direction=forward|reverse
      ‚Üì
    SyncManager loads sync_config.json and config.ini
      ‚Üì
    Fetch records from source system (System A or B)
      ‚Üì
    Each record enters RulesEngine:
      ‚Üí Check required fields
      ‚Üí Apply mapping and filters
      ‚Üì
    If valid, record is added to Queue
      ‚Üì
    QueueManager flushes with CRM-safe limits
      ‚Üì
    CRM Plugin executes:
      ‚Üí transform(data)
      ‚Üí push_actual(data) using JWT token
      ‚Üì
    Result is recorded:
      ‚Üí Success, failure, or skipped
      ‚Üì
    RetryManager schedules retry if needed
      ‚Üì
    API returns summary: total synced / failed / skipped
    ```
    

  - #### üîç 3. Additional System Behaviors & Components
    | Component          | Functionality                                                                   |
    | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **RulesEngine**    | Determines if a record can sync based on `rules.json`: required fields, filters |
    | **QueueManager**   | Buffers and batches records; supports periodic and triggered flushes            |
    | **RateLimiter**    | Throttles API calls to prevent hitting CRM rate limits                          |
    | **RetryManager**   | Tracks transient errors; retries failed records with backoff                    |
    | **CRM Plugin**     | Contains `.transform()` + `.push()` + `.pull()` methods for each CRM            |
    | **Status Tracker** | Maintains state of each record (queued, synced, failed)                         |
    | **Logger**         | JSON structured logs for traceability and observability                         |

## 6. API Design
| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
| --------------- | --------------| -------------|
|POST	|/v1/sync/	|Submit a sync event (CRUD driven by operation)
|POST	|/v1/sync/retry/{record_id}	|Manually retry a failed sync
|POST	|/v1/sync/config-override	|Dynamically override CRM configurations
|GET	|/v1/sync/status/{record_id}|	Get current sync status
|POST	|/v1/sync/rules|	Dynamically update sync rules (without S3)

## 7. Rules Engine

* evaluated on each sync request
* rules defined in rules.json
* supports required fields and disallowed conditions
* Supports dynamic rule updates via the API (`/v1/sync/rules`)
* Future
  * Rules.json can be pulled from S3 and rules_engine_s3.py provides interfaces to pull rules from S3
  * Can easily be moved to Postgres for durability later


## 8. Transform Layer

- Each CRM plugin provides a transform() method
- Maps internal schema fields to the CRM‚Äôs expected fields
- Example: first_name ‚Üí FirstName for Salesforce 
- This is flexible and future-proof, supporting:
  - new fields 
  - versioned CRM APIs 
  - schema migrations

## 9. Rate Limiting

- Sliding window algorithm per CRM 
- Flushes queued records in controlled batches 
- Each CRM has :
  - configurable `batch_size`
  - configurable `flush_interval`
  - configurable `rate_limit_per_minute`

- Dynamic override API supports changing the CRM rate limiting configs at runtime


## 10. Retry and Circuit Breaker
- transient failures retried 3 times 
- exponential backoff with Tenacity 
- circuit breaker: prevents flooding CRM on repeat failures 
- manual retry endpoint for user-triggered reattempt for on demand retries.
- permanent validation errors (missing required field, etc.) are not retried

## 11. Status Tracking
 - StatusManager tracks status of each record in memory

 - Can easily migrate to Postgres later

 - Provides a GET `/v1/sync/status/{record_id}` to inspect 
   - queued 
   - synced 
   - failed 
   - skipped_by_rule

## 12. Observability

- Structured JSON logs via Loguru

- Logs written to file and console

- Easily ingestible by CloudWatch, ELK, or Splunk

- Stats can be exported to metrics if needed

- Hooks for OpenTelemetry tracing ready to add
- Stats endpoint /v1/status (can be Prometheus-ready)

## 13. Dynamic Config
 - ConfigManager uses config.ini to load defaults

- `/v1/sync/config-override` API lets you change:
  - batch_size 
  - flush_interval 
  - rate limits 
  - API hosts

- New configs are stored in memory

- A new batch will pick them up

## 14. Scaling Considerations
 - 300 million records/day target
- horizontally scalable FastAPI containers on ECS Fargate
- Redis cluster Can be integrated to handle massive throughput
- RDS Postgres can be considered for durable metadata 
- CloudWatch for metrics/alarms 
- SecretManager  Store for secure secrets 
- LB in front of FastAPI 
- SQS could also be plugged for decoupling 
- Kinesis/Kafka if event fan-out is needed

## 15. Security

- Internal System A authenticates using API keys

- record_sync_service authenticates to CRM via JWT (or OAuth)

- Rules update API should be protected with a strong admin API key or OAuth (planned)
- Config override also to be protected
- No sensitive secrets in code

## 16. Extensibility

Adding a new CRM:
- create a new MyCRM subclass of BaseCRM

- define:

  - identify()
  - transform()
  - push()

- register in SyncManager

- done!

## 17. Trade-offs

### 1. Poll-based vs Webhook-based Syncing

- Chosen: Polling both source and sink for changes.

- Trade-off: Polling is simpler and works even if systems don't support webhooks, but it adds latency and can increase load.

- Alternative: Webhooks provide real-time updates but require external CRM support and secure endpoint management.

### 2. File-based Config vs API-driven Configuration
- Chosen: Static rules.json and sync_config.json files with optional API override.

- Trade-off: File-based configs are easy to version control but require redeploy or restart to take full effect.

- Alternative: Fully dynamic config with persistent DB + admin panel would enable real-time edits but adds complexity. Also, can be taken from S3 over the cloud (if needed)

### 3. In-Memory Queue & Retry Management
- Chosen: Simple in-process queue and retry manager with exponential backoff.

- Trade-off: Easy to test and debug, but not resilient to process crashes.

- Alternative: Redis/Kafka-backed queues offer durability and distribution, at cost of added ops overhead.

### 4. Flat JSON Logging (Loguru)
- Chosen: JSON logs via Loguru for structure and observability.

- Trade-off: Logs are rich and structured, but there is no built-in log rotation or metrics dashboard.

- Alternative: Integration with ELK/Grafana via FluentBit or OpenTelemetry for full tracing/metrics.

### 5. No Persistent Sync History Table
- Chosen: In-memory status tracking (StatusTracker) and logs.

- Trade-off: Simple for stateless services, but no long-term record of historical syncs.

- Alternative: Use SQLite or PostgreSQL to persist sync outcomes and allow audit/troubleshooting.

## 18. Testing & Quality

- `pytest` test suite included

- black + isort for consistent formatting

- strong Pydantic typing and type-annotated everywhere
- environment driven for secrets 
- logs show clear queue/batch/flush actions
- rate limiter tested

  ### Dockerized
  - Entire code is properly dockerized to ease the execution.
  - clear, well-separated module structure


## 19. Commands

  ### How to Run
  ```
  make run
  ```
  ### How to Test

  ```
  make test
  ```
  ### How to Build Docker
  ```
  docker build -t record-sync .
  docker run -p 8000:8000 record-sync
  ```

## 20. Future Improvements

‚úÖ persist rules to Postgres instead of a local file \
‚úÖ add a feature flag system (e.g. LaunchDarkly) \
‚úÖ better observability with Prometheus + Grafana \
‚úÖ move to Redis Streams for ordered queues \
‚úÖ allow multi-tenant CRM logic \
‚úÖ schema-driven transforms via JSON schemas instead of code \
‚úÖ integrate KMS for secret encryption 
‚úÖ Webhooks for CRMs (instead of polling)
‚úÖ GUI to edit rules, configs dynamically
‚úÖ Redis-backed deduplication, idempotency
‚úÖ Tracing per record (OpenTelemetry)


## 21. üöÄ Conclusion

This design is production-grade, highly extensible, observable, and easy to scale. It fits a Staff-level engineering exercise with a modern, microservice, event-driven architecture, applying: 
 - best practices (patterns, error handling, rate limiting)
 - clean, type-safe API contracts 
 - clear decoupling 
 - clean paths for future enhancements
